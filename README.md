# Feedback and Proposed Changes
* So far the list of objectives for one seminar seems to be long and cover a lot of concepts, if this is the case, again maybe break this into multiple optional seminar, otherwise condense language here

* Cross-validation code is cumbersome and a bit intimidating to edit for the questions immediately proceeding, I'm proposing a change here

* ROCR had no roc function for calculating AUC so I wrote one using ROCR

* Multiclass learning might add on too much information to this seminar, perhaps it would be best in another seminar, or as an aside at the end of this
